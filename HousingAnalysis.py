    Cause 1: Sample size imbalance
One possible cause of heterogeneity of covariance matrices is that the sample sizes of the groups are very different. 
For example, if you have 10 observations in one group and 100 in another, the smaller group may have more variability 
and less stability in its covariance matrix than the larger group. This can lead to unequal error terms and biased 
estimates of the group differences. To avoid this problem, you should try to balance the sample sizes of the groups as 
much as possible, or use a robust method of MANOVA that can handle unequal sample sizes, such as the Box's M test or 
the Pillai's trace criterion.
